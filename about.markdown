### About the blog

{: style="text-align: justify;"}
As Developers, we encounter both the sillest and the head breaker problems everyday. Here I am trying to log my reasons of sleepless nights and save you some :)
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

**DevDoc** is a wanna be tech doctor helping the fellow patients to solve the problems without having to refer to hundreds of pages for a single problem. Through this blog I bring to you the problems I spent hours and hours on and eventually made things work. 



### About Me

{: style="text-align: justify;"}
Hi, I am **Karan Nagpal!** I am a techie during the day and an explorer during the night.

I am a person who will pick up his bag and run towards the hills (or the sea, whichever is closer) at the tiniest hint of an opportunity. I also love solving real problems and I see tech as my break through to this world. I take the lessons I learn from these problems to my life and solve problems. 

{: style="text-align: justify;"}
*P.S. I love jumping off from airplanes, cliffs and exploring the sea life.*
